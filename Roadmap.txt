A general structure:
A player class (with an instance for each player) that knows the locations of that player's pieces, 
	the number of moves that player has for each, how many trees that player has, and their deck object
	Must differentiate between human and AI players (a crappy AI will hopefully be implemented)
A deck class (with an instance for each player) that knows the composition of that player's deck, 
	as well as their hand and discard, and is responsible for drawing, shuffling, and exchanging
A board class that tracks the locations of pieces and trees and is responsible for detecting groves,
	owl-squirrel collisions, and nuts that will flourish. 
An overarching game class that coordinates between these and tracks turns, phases, and cycles
